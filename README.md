Aim of our project was to develop a virtual disease diagnosis system using machine learning.

Collected a dataset of 132 symptoms for predicting approximately 43 diseases.
Front-End development using HTML, CSS
Machine Learning Model used - Random Forest, SVM to accurately predict disease - successfully we have trained the model
There are still some errors in prediction, we are trying to correct it
Finally trying to make an API and establish connection between frontend & backend


Programming Language Used:

Python
HTML, CSS
